# Tic-Tac-Toe


This code creates a Tic Tac Toe game with a 3x3 grid using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses flexbox to center the game board and the status message, and it resizes the cells to adapt to the screen width. It also displays the game in a single column on mobile devices. The game allows players to click on a cell to place their piece, and it checks for winning and drawing conditions. It also has a clickable button that resets the game board.
